In recent years, more companies tend to commit fraudulent activities without being detected, often in a bid to meet market expectations and attract more investors. To counter this, the use of data and advanced analytics in fraud detection has become much more prevalent. Intuitively, companies that issue restatements are more likely to have committed fraud, and thus in this project, we will be using the restatement data from 2010 to 2015 to observe relationships in financial behavior with fraud. Using external data sources outlining companies’ financial statements, the project first observes the relationship between abnormal accruals and restatements. Other feature’s effects are also investigated and tested for significance with regards to fraud. This process is repeated for additional fraud/restatement data set for performance comparison. Finally, the determined significant factors are applied to predict which firms are likely to commit fraud and issue restatements in 2018.&nbsp;
